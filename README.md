Project Overview:

This project, undertaken for the United States Geological Survey (USGS), aimed to create an interactive visualization tool for earthquake data. The USGS collects extensive seismic data globally, which necessitates effective tools to interpret and communicate the data to the public and relevant stakeholders. My role was to develop an application that visualizes earthquake data to enhance public understanding and aid in educational and policy-making efforts.

Objective:

The primary objective was to develop a dynamic and interactive map that displays real-time earthquake data, allowing users to visually comprehend the magnitude and depth of earthquakes as they occur globally. This tool is intended to help the USGS better educate the public and secure additional funding by demonstrating the impacts of seismic activity clearly and compellingly.

Technical Execution:

Data Acquisition:
Accessed real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, which updates every five minutes with detailed seismic activity reports.
Chose the "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" dataset for a comprehensive view of global seismic activity.

Map Development:
Utilized Leaflet.js, a leading open-source JavaScript library, to develop the interactive map.
Integrated the GeoJSON data into the map to plot earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

Visualization Features:
Configured data markers to reflect the earthquake's magnitude by size, making larger markers denote more significant earthquakes.
Used a color gradient to represent the depth of earthquakes, with deeper quakes showing in darker colors.
Implemented interactive popups for each marker, providing detailed information about the earthquake, such as magnitude, location, and depth.

Map Controls and Legends:
Added a custom legend to the map to provide context for marker colors and sizes, aiding in user interpretation of the data.
Incorporated various base maps and overlay options, allowing users to switch views and compare different data sets, including tectonic plates, which highlight regions of seismic risk.

Deployment and Testing:
Deployed the visualization tool on GitHub Pages, providing easy access and widespread availability.
Conducted rigorous testing to ensure functionality across all features and compatibility with various devices and browsers.

Outcomes:

The interactive earthquake visualization tool successfully:
Displays real-time data on earthquakes, enhancing public awareness and understanding.
Provides an educational resource that can be used in schools and public safety programs.
Assists USGS in demonstrating their capabilities and the importance of their work to secure funding.

Challenges and Learnings:
Integrating real-time data from the USGS GeoJSON feed presented challenges in data handling and visualization, which were overcome by using efficient data parsing and mapping techniques.
Customizing the Leaflet.js library to suit specific visualization needs required in-depth learning but resulted in a highly tailored tool that met all project requirements.

Conclusion:
This project has significantly contributed to the USGSâ€™s mission of informing and educating the public about natural hazards. By making earthquake data accessible and understandable, the visualization tool not only serves educational purposes but also enhances disaster preparedness and response efforts.
